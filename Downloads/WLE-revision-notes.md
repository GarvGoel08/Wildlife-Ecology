## Week 1: Ecology & Evolution

### Definitions
- **Ecology**: Scientific study of organisms and their environment
- **Evolution**: **Genetic adaptation** of organisms to their environment
- **Adaptation**: Alteration in structure/function allowing better survival and reproduction
- **Fitness**: Ability to leave descendants in future generations relative to others

### Natural Selection - 5 Steps
1. **Variation**: Individuals differ in characteristics
2. **Overpopulation**: Excess offspring production (e.g., mosquitoes lay 500-1000 eggs)
3. **Struggle for Existence**: Limited resources; not all offspring survive
4. **Survival of the Fittest**: Best adapted individuals survive and reproduce
5. **Changes in Gene Pool**: Favorable traits increase in population

### Types of Natural Selection
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Directional** | Selection against one extreme | Long tails mimic snakes; scare predators |
| **Stabilizing** | Selection against both extremes | Robin eggs: 4 eggs optimal (not too many/few) |
| **Disruptive** | Selection against the mean | Short tails ground-dwelling; long tails tree-dwelling |

### Coevolution
**Definition**: Evolution of two or more species with close interactions; each adapts to changes in the other
- **Example**: Predator-prey relationships

## Week 2: Levels of Organization

### Biological Hierarchy (Bottom to Top)
1. **Sub-cellular organelle**: Specialized subunits (mitochondrion, chloroplast)
2. **Cell**: Basic structural and functional unit
3. **Tissue**: Ensemble of similar cells (blood, bone, epithelial, muscle, nervous)
4. **Organ**: Collection of tissues with similar functions
5. **Organ System**: Group of organs working together
6. **Organism**: Individual with life properties
7. **Population**: Same species in geographical area capable of interbreeding
8. **Community**: Populations of different species in same geographical area
9. **Ecosystem**: Community + non-living components (air, water, soil)
10. **Biome**: Community with common environmental characteristics
11. **Biosphere**: Worldwide sum of all ecosystems

### Key Principles
- **Simon's Hierarchical Principle**: Hierarchy emerges for stability
- **Emergent Principle**: "Whole > sum of parts"; whole has properties parts don't have
  - **Example**: Fire ants form rafts with altered hydrophobicity, elasticity, viscosity

|-------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Colonies** | N/A | N/A | Coral reefs, microbial colonies |
| **Societies** | N/A | N/A | Bee hives, termite mounds, wolf packs |
| **Protocooperation** | Yes | No | Cleaner fish, hermit crab + anemone |
| **Mutualism** | Yes | Yes | Rhizobium in legume roots; ruminant microbes |
| **Commensalism** | One yes, other 0 | No | Bacteria on skin; egrets with buffalo |

### Inharmonious Interactions (Negative)
| Interaction | First | Second | Example |
|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Competition** | - | - | Organisms for same niche |
| **Parasitism** | + | - | Parasite lives at host's expense |
| **Predation** | + | - | Predator kills prey for food |
| **Ammensalism** | - | 0 | Grass trampled by animals |
| **Cannibalism** | - | - | Consuming own species |

### Competition Types

- **Exploitative (Scramble)**: Organisms consume resources directly; no direct contact
- **Interference (Contest)**: Direct conflict; aggressive displays/fighting

### Apparent Competition
- Interaction between two prey with common predator
- Increase in one prey → increase predator → stronger predation on second prey
- Results in indirect competition

### Consequences of Competition
- **Niche Differentiation**: Species occupy different niches

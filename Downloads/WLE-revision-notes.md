### Ecology and Evolution

**Ecology**: Scientific study of interactions among organisms and their environment

**Evolution**: Genetic adaptation of organisms to their environment

#### Key Concepts
- **Adaptation**: Alteration in structure/function making organism better suited to environment; inheritable trait
- **Fitness**: Ability to leave descendants relative to other organisms; environment and species-specific
- **Natural Selection**: Process where best-adapted organisms survive and pass genetic traits to succeeding generations

#### Five Steps in Natural Selection
1. **Variation**: Individuals have different characteristics
2. **Overpopulation**: Organisms produce excess offspring
3. **Struggle for Existence**: Limited resources; not all offspring survive
4. **Survival of the Fittest**: Best-adapted individuals survive and reproduce
5. **Gene Pool Changes**: Inherited favorable traits increase in population frequency

#### Three Kinds of Selection
- **Directional Selection**: Selection against one extreme; population shifts toward other extreme
- **Stabilizing Selection**: Selection against both extremes; moderate traits favored
- **Disruptive Selection**: Selection against mean; both extremes favored

#### Coevolution
Evolution of two or more species that interact closely, each adapting to changes in the other

## Week 2: Ecological Structure

### Levels of Organization
- **Sub-cellular Organelle**: Mitochondrion, chloroplast, nucleus
- **Cell**: Basic structural and biological unit of life
- **Tissue**: Ensemble of similar cells performing specific function
- **Organ**: Collection of tissues with similar functions
- **Organ System**: Group of organs working together for function
- **Organism**: Individual exhibiting life properties

- **Ecosystem**: Community + non-living components (air, water, soil)
- **Biome**: Community of plants/animals with common environmental characteristics
- **Biosphere**: Worldwide sum of all ecosystems

### Simon's Hierarchical Principle
- Hierarchy emerges through evolutionary processes because **hierarchical structures are stable**
- Complex systems organized into stable subsystems

### Emergent Principle
- **"The whole is greater than sum of parts"**
- Whole has properties its parts don't have
- Example: Fire ants forming rafts with altered hydrophobicity, elasticity, viscosity

### Biodiversity

#### Types of Biodiversity
- **Species Biodiversity**: How many species; how distributed
- **Genetic Biodiversity**: Diversity at phyla, families, species, population, individual levels

  - **Heterozygosity (H)**: Proportion of genes where average individual is heterozygous
- **Ecosystem Biodiversity**: How many ecosystems; how distributed

#### Measures of Biodiversity

- **Beta Biodiversity**: Among different ecosystems
- **Gamma Biodiversity**: Among different geographies

#### Biodiversity Hotspots

#### Why Do Some Areas Have More Biodiversity?
1. **Evolutionary Speed Hypothesis**: More time/rapid evolution = more biodiversity
2. **Geographical Area Hypothesis**: Larger area + complex habitats = more biodiversity
3. **Interspecific Interactions Hypothesis**: Competition and predation maintain diversity
4. **Ambient Energy Hypothesis**: More energy = more biodiversity
5. **Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis**: Moderate disturbance maintains maximum diversity

#### Economic Value of Biodiversity

**Costs**: Competition for food, Increased disease/parasite risk, Loss of paternity, Brood parasitism

#### Kin Selection and Hamilton's Rule
- **Kin Selection**: Evolution of traits increasing relatives' reproductive success
- **Hamilton's Rule**: Genes increase when **rB > C**
  - r = genetic relatedness
  - B = reproductive benefit to recipient
  - C = reproductive cost to actor
- **Haldane's Statement**: Saving 2 siblings/4 nephews/8 cousins fair deal

#### Territoriality

- ~90% lost in transfer, digestion, respiration
- Plant efficiency capturing sun's energy ~1%

**Example**: 100,000 J sun → 1,000 J grass → 100 J grasshopper → 10 J frog → 1 J snake → 0.1 J hawk

### Primary Production

**Primary Production**: Synthesis of organic compounds from CO₂ through photosynthesis/chemosynthesis

### Impact Equation

**I = P × A × T**

Where:

- Highest in urban areas
- Lowest in inhospitable regions

### Match-Mismatch Hypothesis

- Production of eggs, larvae, and larval food have distributions in time
- Match or mismatch determined by overlap between fish larval production and food availability
- Impacts recruitment success

### Tragedy of the Commons

Given by Garrett Hardin (1968):
- Rational individuals maximize personal gain
- Positive utility from additional exploitation nearly +1
- Negative utility of overuse shared by all nearly -1/N
- Result: Each individual rationally adds more → ruin for all
- "Freedom in commons brings ruin to all"

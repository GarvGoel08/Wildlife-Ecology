### 1.3 Ecology and Evolution

**The Darwin-Ecology Connection:**

**Natural Selection:**
- Organisms with traits better suited to their environment survive and reproduce more successfully
- **Fitness**: The ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment
- Ecology provides the environmental context for natural selection

**Key Evolutionary Concepts in Ecology:**

1. **Adaptation**
   - Traits that enhance survival and reproduction
   - Result from natural selection acting on variation
   - Can be morphological, physiological, or behavioral

2. **Co-evolution**
   - Reciprocal evolutionary change between interacting species
   - Examples: predator-prey relationships, plant-pollinator interactions

3. **Ecological Niche**
   - The role and position a species has in its environment
   - Includes both habitat and functional role
   - Product of evolutionary adaptation

**Selection Pressures:**
- **Biotic factors**: Competition, predation, parasitism, disease
- **Abiotic factors**: Temperature, moisture, light, nutrients

**Life History Strategies:**
- **r-selected species**: High reproductive rate, small body size, short life span, adapted to unstable environments
- **K-selected species**: Low reproductive rate, large body size, long life span, adapted to stable environments

**Evolutionary Ecology Applications:**
- Understanding species distributions
- Predicting responses to environmental change
- Conservation of genetic diversity
- Management of invasive species

## Week 2: Ecological Structure

### 2.1 The Levels of Organization

**Hierarchical Organization in Ecology:**

Ecology studies life at multiple scales, organized hierarchically:

**Individual/Organism:**
- A single living being capable of independent function
- Basic unit of ecological study
- Interacts with environment through behavior, physiology, and morphology

**Population:**
- Group of individuals of the same species in a defined area
- Share gene pool and reproduce together
- Characteristics: size, density, distribution, age structure

**Community:**
- All populations of different species living together in an area
- Species interactions shape community structure
- Characterized by species composition and diversity

**Ecosystem:**
- Community plus its abiotic environment
- Energy flow and nutrient cycling
- Functional unit of ecology

**Biome:**
- Large-scale community characterized by distinctive vegetation and climate
- Examples: tropical rainforest, grassland, desert, tundra

**Biosphere:**
- Global sum of all ecosystems
- All life on Earth and the environments that support it
- Extends from deep oceans to upper atmosphere

**The Hierarchical System (Simon's Theory):**
- Proposed by Herbert Simon
- **Emergent principle**: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
- Properties emerge at each level that cannot be predicted from lower levels
- **Stability**: Hierarchical structures are more stable than non-hierarchical ones

**Why Hierarchy Matters:**
- Simplifies complex ecological systems
- Allows study at appropriate scales
- Facilitates understanding of interactions
- Critical for management and conservation decisions

### 2.2 Species Abundance and Composition: Biodiversity

**Species Concept:**

**Biological Species Definition:**
"Groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups"

**Biodiversity Levels:**

1. **Genetic Diversity**
   - Variation in genes within species
   - Foundation for adaptation and evolution
   - Critical for long-term species survival

2. **Species Diversity**
   - Variety of species in an area
   - Most commonly measured level
   - Includes both richness and evenness

3. **Ecosystem Diversity**
   - Variety of habitats and ecological processes
   - Landscape-level diversity
   - Important for ecosystem services

**Types of Biodiversity (by Scale):**

- **Alpha (α) Biodiversity**: Diversity within an ecosystem or habitat
- **Beta (β) Biodiversity**: Diversity between different ecosystems
- **Gamma (γ) Biodiversity**: Total diversity across a landscape or region

**Factors Affecting Biodiversity:**

1. **Competition and Predation**
   - More competition + more predation = MORE biodiversity
   - Intermediate disturbance hypothesis
   - Prevents competitive exclusion

2. **Environmental Heterogeneity**
   - More varied habitats support more species
   - Spatial complexity increases niche availability

3. **Productivity**
   - Moderate productivity often supports highest diversity
   - Resource availability affects species coexistence

4. **Disturbance**
   - **Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis**: Moderate disturbance maintains highest diversity
   - Too little: competitive exclusion
   - Too much: only stress-tolerant species survive
   - Intermediate: allows coexistence

**Measuring Biodiversity:**

**Species Richness:**
- Simple count of species
- Most basic measure
- Doesn't account for relative abundance

**Diversity Indices:**

1. **Shannon-Weiner Index (H)**
   - Formula: H = -Σ(pi × ln pi)
   - Where pi = proportion of individuals of species i
   - Emphasizes rare species
   - Values typically range 1.5-3.5
   - Higher values = greater diversity

2. **Simpson's Index (D)**
   - Formula: D = Σ(pi²)
   - Measures dominance
   - Values range 0-1
   - Lower values = higher diversity
   - Less sensitive to rare species

3. **Evenness Indices**
   - Pielou's Evenness: J = H/Hmax
   - Measures how evenly individuals are distributed among species
   - Values 0-1, where 1 = perfectly even

**Importance of Biodiversity:**
- Ecosystem stability and resilience
- Ecosystem services (pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling)
- Economic value (medicines, food, materials)
- Cultural and aesthetic value
- Insurance against environmental change

### 2.3 Biodiversity - II

**Patterns of Biodiversity:**

**Latitudinal Gradient:**
- Biodiversity generally decreases from equator to poles
- Tropical regions have highest species richness
- Explanations: climate stability, productivity, evolutionary time

**Altitudinal Gradient:**
- Biodiversity generally decreases with elevation
- Similar patterns to latitudinal gradient
- Microclimate variation creates exceptions

**Island Biogeography:**
- Species richness related to island size and isolation
- Immigration-extinction balance
- Larger islands closer to mainland = more species

**Biodiversity Hotspots:**

**Global Hotspots:**
- Regions with exceptional concentrations of endemic species
- Experiencing exceptional habitat loss
- Prioritized for conservation

**Indian Biodiversity Hotspots:**
1. **Himalayan Region**
   - Eastern Himalayas
   - High endemism
   - Threatened by development and climate change

2. **Western Ghats**
   - One of world's eight "hottest" hotspots

## Week 3: Ecological Interactions

### 3.1 Positive Interactions

**Types of Interactions:**

Ecological interactions can be classified based on their effects on participating organisms:
- (+/+) Mutualism
- (+/0) Commensalism
- (+/0) Protocooperation
- (0/0) Neutralism

**1. Mutualism (+/+)**

Both species benefit from the interaction.

**Types of Mutualism:**

a) **Obligate Mutualism**
   - Essential for survival of both species
   - Cannot survive without partner
   - Example: Termites and gut protozoa (cellulose digestion)

b) **Facultative Mutualism**
   - Beneficial but not essential
   - Can survive independently
   - Example: Pollination relationships (bees and flowers)

**Examples:**
- **Pollination**: Bees get nectar, plants get pollination
- **Seed Dispersal**: Animals get food, plants get dispersal
- **Mycorrhizae**: Fungi get carbohydrates, plants get nutrients
- **Nitrogen Fixation**: Rhizobium bacteria and legumes
- **Cleaning Symbiosis**: Cleaner fish remove parasites from larger fish

**2. Commensalism (+/0)**

One species benefits, the other is neither helped nor harmed.

**Examples:**
- **Egrets with buffaloes**: Birds get insects disturbed by grazing, buffalo unaffected
- **Epiphytes on trees**: Plants get support and light, trees unaffected
- **Remoras on sharks**: Fish get transportation and food scraps, shark unaffected
- **Birds nesting in trees**: Birds get shelter, trees unaffected

**3. Protocooperation (+/+)**

Both species benefit, but the interaction is not obligatory.

**Distinction from Mutualism:**
- Less specific relationship
- Not essential for survival
- More opportunistic

**Examples:**
- Certain ants and plants (non-obligate protection)
- Some pollination relationships

**4. Harmonious Interactions (0/0)**

Both participants are unharmed - **Neutralism**.

**Ecological Significance of Positive Interactions:**
- Facilitate coexistence
- Increase ecosystem productivity
- Enhance community stability
- Critical for ecosystem functioning
- Important for restoration ecology

---

### 3.2 Negative Interactions

**Competition (-/-)**

**Interspecific Competition:**
- Competition between different species
- For limited resources (food, water, space, light, mates)

**Types:**
1. **Exploitation Competition**
   - Indirect - consumption of shared resources
   - No direct interaction between competitors
   - Example: Different herbivore species feeding on same plant

2. **Interference Competition**
   - Direct - physical interaction
   - One species actively prevents another from accessing resources
   - Example: Territorial behavior, allelopathy

**Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause's Principle):**
- Two species with identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely
- One will outcompete and exclude the other
- Result: niche partitioning or local extinction

**Apparent Competition:**
- Interaction between species through shared predator
- Increase in one prey species leads to predator increase
- This increased predation affects other prey species
- Example: Exotic shrubs and trees through seed predators

**Intraspecific Competition:**
- Competition within same species
- Can be more intense than interspecific
- Drives population regulation
- Leads to territoriality and social hierarchies

**Predation (+/-)**

One organism (predator) kills and consumes another (prey).

**Types:**
1. **True Predation**: Predator kills and eats prey
2. **Herbivory**: Animals eating plants
3. **Parasitoidism**: Insect larvae developing on/in host, eventually killing it

**Predator-Prey Dynamics:**
- **Lotka-Volterra Model**: Mathematical description of predator-prey oscillations
- Predator and prey populations cycle
- Time lag in predator response to prey abundance

**Predator Effects:**
- Control prey populations
- Select for prey defenses
- Influence prey behavior and distribution
- Maintain prey diversity (by preventing dominance)
- Create trophic cascades

**Prey Defenses:**
1. **Behavioral**: Vigilance, alarm calls, hiding, group living
2. **Morphological**: Camouflage, armor, spines, size
3. **Chemical**: Toxins, deterrents
4. **Life History**: High reproductive rate, rapid development

**Parasitism (+/-)**

Parasite benefits at expense of host without immediately killing it.

**Characteristics:**
- Smaller than host
- Live on or in host
- Reduce host fitness
- May cause death eventually

**Types:**
1. **Ectoparasites**: Live on host surface (ticks, fleas, leeches)
2. **Endoparasites**: Live inside host (tapeworms, protozoa)

**Parasitoid:**
- Intermediate between parasite and predator
- Larvae develop on/in host
- Always kills host eventually
- Common in insects

**Amensalism (-/0)**

One species is harmed, the other is unaffected.

**Examples:**
- **Allelopathy**: Plants producing chemicals that inhibit other plants
- **Trampling**: Large animals damaging plants while moving
- Cattle grazing affecting small animals

- Energy transformations are inefficient
- Some energy always lost as heat
- Entropy increases

**Energy Flow Characteristics:**
- **Unidirectional**: Flows from sun through ecosystem, not recycled
- **Decreases at each level**: Only ~10% passes to next trophic level
- **Limits food chain length**: Usually 4-5 trophic levels maximum

---

### 4.2 Trophic Levels and Food Chains

**Trophic Levels:**

Represent position of organism in energy flow pathway.

**Primary Producers (Autotrophs):**
- **First Trophic Level**
- Create organic matter from inorganic materials
- **Photosynthesis**: Use sunlight energy (plants, algae, cyanobacteria)
- **Chemosynthesis**: Use chemical energy (certain bacteria)

**Primary Consumers (Herbivores):**
- **Second Trophic Level**
- Feed directly on producers
- Examples: Grasshoppers, deer, rabbits, zooplankton

**Secondary Consumers (Primary Carnivores):**
- **Third Trophic Level**
- Feed on herbivores
- Examples: Small carnivores, insectivores

**Tertiary Consumers (Secondary Carnivores):**
- **Fourth Trophic Level**
- Feed on primary carnivores
- Examples: Large predators

**Quaternary Consumers (Top Carnivores):**

**Types:**

1. **Grazing Food Chain**
   - Starts with living plants
   - Most common in terrestrial ecosystems
   - Example: Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Eagle

2. **Detritus Food Chain**
   - Starts with dead organic matter
   - Dominant in aquatic and forest ecosystems
   - Example: Dead leaves → Earthworm → Bird

**10% Law (Lindeman's Law):**

- Their removal causes major changes
- Not necessarily abundant
- Examples: Sea otters, wolves, elephants

**Trophic Cascades:**
- Effects of predators cascade down food web
- Top-down control of ecosystem
- Example: Wolves → Elk → Vegetation in Yellowstone

**Energy Efficiency:**

**Gross Primary Productivity (GPP):**

**Net Primary Productivity (NPP):**
- GPP minus plant respiration
- Energy available to herbivores
- NPP = GPP - Respiration

**Secondary Productivity:**
- Rate of biomass production by consumers
- Always less than NPP due to energy loss

**Ecological Efficiency:**
- Percentage of energy transferred between levels
- Typically 5-20%, average ~10%
- Lower in terrestrial than aquatic systems

### 4.4 Ecological Pyramids

**Types of Ecological Pyramids:**

**1. Pyramid of Numbers**

Shows number of individual organisms at each trophic level.

**Upright Pyramid:**
- Common in grassland, pond ecosystems
- Producers most numerous
- Numbers decrease at higher levels
- Example: Grass → Grasshoppers → Frogs → Snakes → Hawks

**Inverted Pyramid:**
- Can occur in tree ecosystems
- One tree supports many insects
- Many insects support fewer birds
- Example: Tree → Insects → Birds → Predators

**Spindle-shaped:**
- Primary consumers most numerous
- Both producers and top predators less numerous

**2. Pyramid of Biomass**

Shows total dry mass at each trophic level (g/m² or kg/ha).

**Upright Pyramid:**
- Common in terrestrial ecosystems
- Biomass decreases at higher levels
- Examples: Forests, grasslands
- Total plant biomass > herbivore biomass > carnivore biomass

**Inverted Pyramid:**
- Can occur in aquatic ecosystems
- Phytoplankton reproduce rapidly despite low biomass
- Example: Ocean ecosystems

### 5.3 Population Growth and Regulation

**Population Growth Models:**

**1. Exponential Growth (J-shaped curve)**

**Assumptions:**
- Unlimited resources
- No competition
- Ideal conditions
- Constant birth and death rates

**Equation:**
- dN/dt = rN
- Where:
  - N = population size
  - t = time
  - r = intrinsic rate of increase
  - dN/dt = rate of change in population

**Solution:**

**2. Tolerance**
- Later species more tolerant of resource depletion
- Can grow in shade, poor soil
- Gradually replace pioneers

**3. Inhibition**
- Early species inhibit later species
- Later species only enter after disturbance
- Longest-lived species dominate

**Succession Concepts:**

**Nudation:**
- Development of bare area
- Caused by: topographic, climatic, biotic factors

**Invasion:**
- Colonization by organisms

  1. **Migration**: Dispersal to site
  2. **Ecesis**: Establishment
  3. **Aggregation**: Population growth

**Competition and Coaction:**
- Species interactions intensify
- Competition for resources
- Weak competitors displaced

**Reaction:**
- Organisms modify environment
- Change soil, microclimate
- Make area suitable/unsuitable for themselves

**Stabilization:**
- Climax community reached
- Balance with environment
- Relatively stable

**Types of Climax:**

**Climatic Climax:**
